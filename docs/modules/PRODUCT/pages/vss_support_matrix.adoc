= Support Matrix

TIP: This document is currently in public beta and being worked on actively

The tables list the officially and by default supported clouds and main features. If a cloud or a feature / combination is not listed, it's not supported by VSHN by default.

* *Provisioning*: How the cluster gets provisioned / configured / customized
* *Autoscaling*: Is support for autoscaling available or not
* *Application HA*: Is access to applications available in high-availability? This means: HS Load-balancer and IP HA
* *Storage*: Which storage options are available (CSI included, storage cluster is an addon)
* *Load Balancer*: Implementation of network level load balancer

== Red Hat OpenShift 4

* No compute workload is allowed on control plane nodes
* Control plane must run on fast storage (for etcd)
* The bootstrap VM is only used for a short time and therefore not listed in this table: +
4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, 120 GB storage, RHCOS
* The load balancer is only needed on some clouds (see Support Matrix)

=== Maximum Supported by VSHN
