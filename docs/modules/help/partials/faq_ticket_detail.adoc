=== Why can't I close some tickets?

Some tickets might be in such a state that can't be closed. Only new tickets, tickets in "backlog" and in "customer review" status can be closed. If you need to close such a ticket, please write a comment requesting to change the state.

=== How can I add secrets (passwords, keys, etc.) to tickets?

To communicate secrets to VSHNeers with a secure mechanism, follow these steps:

. After creating a new ticket, click on it on the list of tickets, and scroll down until the section "Secrets" is visible.
. Click on the btn:[Add Secret] button.
. Enter a name for the secret in the **Name** field.
. Enter the value of the secret in the **Secret** field.
+
NOTE: You can enter any free-text information here, e.g. SSH keys, environment variables, certificates, etc.

. Select "Week" or "Day" in the **Time to live (TTL)** field.
. Click on the btn:[Save] button.

The VSHN Portal is designed in such a way that secrets transmitted through this mechanism can only be viewed once, which prevents anyone else from accessing them.

[[multiple-secrets]]
=== How many secrets can I add in a ticket?

You can add as many secrets as needed in a single ticket; you do not need to open separate tickets for each (for example, one for each environment). Just enter them in the field separated by whitespace, as shown in the following screenshot.
