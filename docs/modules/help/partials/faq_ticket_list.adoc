=== Why can't I see some of my tickets?

The ticket list groups tickets depending on their nature:

1. Tickets that belong to a project; and
2. Tickets that do not (yet) belong to a project.

The image below shows these two groups.

<1> Tickets that are part of a project will appear grouped together. Click on the btn:[>] button to expand the project and access individual tickets.
<2> Tickets that are **not** part of a project appear in a separate list.

=== I have lots of tickets. How can I find the one I'm looking for?

When navigating long lists, it can be useful to search for tickets with certain characteristics. The menu:Filter[] section of the screen allows you to conveniently reduce the scope of your search.

.Ticket filter

<1> This drop-down shows options only if you are allowed to search for tickets from different organizations.
<2> Enter here some text describing the ticket, either its title or summary.
<3> Hit the btn:[Search] button to filter tickets. The results will appear below.
<4> You can expand your search to projects without tasks.
<5> You can also expand your search to include closed tickets; by default, only open tickets are shown.
<6> If you need to create a new ticket, just click on the btn:[Create Ticket] button.
