=== When is VSHN notified when I create a new ticket?

VSHNeers are notified immediately of the creation of new tickets. Higher priority tickets trigger additional internal alert systems for a faster response.

=== How can I add secrets (passwords, keys, etc.) to tickets?

After creating a new ticket, click on it on the list, and scroll down until the section "Secrets" is visible.
