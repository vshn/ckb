=== What happens after I submit a new ticket?

Depending on the priority of the ticket and your support SLA, one or many of the following might happen:

* Very often VSHNeers will add comments to the ticket, asking for more information or requesting for your feedback. You will be notified by e-mail of these comments, and you can see the history of conversations in the VSHN Portal.
