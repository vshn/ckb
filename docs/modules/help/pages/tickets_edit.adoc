== Overview

One of the most common use cases of the Control Panel consists in the creation of new tickets. You can access the ticket creation form from various parts of the user interface.

WARNING: Please do not include secrets such as password or private keys in the text of the ticket; please refer to the xref:tickets_edit.adoc#secrets["Frequently Asked Questions" section below] for information about how to securely transmit such information.

The animation below shows how to create a simple ticket, after clicking on the "Create new ticket" link in the xref:dashboard.adoc[Dashboard].

The steps for the creation of a new ticket are the following:

IMPORTANT: The description of the ticket is preferably written in English, as some VSHNeers don't speak German.

. Click on a link or button to access the corresponding form.
. Enter a **summary**, describing the issue in a few words.
. Select a **due date**, if applicable.
. Select a **priority** from the dropdown:
** **Emergency** - Critical impact
*** Production service is down and needs immediate action by VSHN (Outside office hours: Depends on the SLA). Please create the ticket with a detailed description (as much information as possible) and also give us a call.
** **Blocker** - Significant impact
*** Blocks further work from progressing and has the highest priority for action. Please create the ticket with a detailed description (as much information as possible) and describe how it blocks work from progressing.
** **Major** - Limited impact
*** Important issue which doesn't block further work and doesn't require immediate action.
** **Normal** - Minimal impact
*** Does not require immediate action and can be handled on a first-come first-served basis.

. Indicate the servers or OpenShift clusters affected by this issue in the **Affects** field, if applicable.
. Select the names of members of your organization in the **Participants** field, so that they are notified about updates to this ticket.
. Add as much information as possible about the issue at hand in the **Description** field.
