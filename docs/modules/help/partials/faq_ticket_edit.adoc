=== When's VSHN notified when I create a new ticket?

VSHNeers are notified immediately of the creation of new tickets. Higher priority tickets trigger additional internal alert systems for a faster response.

=== What happens after I submit a new ticket?

Depending on the priority of the ticket and your support SLA, one or many of the following might happen:

* Very often VSHNeers will add comments to the ticket, asking for more information or requesting for your feedback. You will be notified by e-mail of these comments, and you can see the history of conversations in the Control Panel.

* Your ticket will change its identification, from `SUPPORT` to the code of your support project. In that case, the layout of the ticket list will change significatly, showing the projects and its associated tickets inside, as shown in the picture below.

=== How can I add secrets (passwords, keys, etc.) to tickets?

To communicate secrets to VSHNeers with a secure mechanism, follow these steps:

. After creating a new ticket, click on it on the list of tickets, and scroll down until the section "Secrets" is visible.
. Click on the btn:[Add Secret] button.
. Enter a name for the secret in the **Name** field.
. Enter the value of the secret in the **Secret** field.
. Select "Week" or "Day" in the **Time to live (TTL)** field. 
. Click on the btn:[Save] button.

Secrets transmitted through this mechanism can only be viewed once, which prevents anyone else from accessing them, and raises an alert if somebody else views it.
